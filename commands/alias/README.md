# alias

alias command instructs the shell to replace one string with another string while executing the commands.

---

## Description
- When we often have to use a single big command multiple times, in those cases, we create something called as alias for that command.
- Alias is like a shortcut command which will have same functionality as if we are writing the whole command.

---

## Syntax
```bash
    $ alias [-p] [name[=value] ... ]
```

---

    $ alias name="value"
    ```

---

## Creating an Unalias (Removing an existing alias)
- ###  Syntax
    ```bash
    $ unalias [alias name]
    ```

---

## Options/Flags
- ###  -p
    Lists all of the aliases that are currently defined in the shell.
    ```bash
    $ alias -p
    ```

## How to permanently store aliases across sessions? 
- We can store aliases in shell configuration files.
- For example for Bash Shell, we can write in ~/.bashrc.
- Let us suppose we want to make an alias of changing to Documents directory as CD. For that go in the .bashrc file and write
    ```bash
    $ alias CD="cd Documents"
    ``` 

---

## Note
- There must not be space before and after the '=' sign in the command.
