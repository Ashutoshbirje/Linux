# Command

alias

## Description

- `alias` command instructs the shell to replace one string with another string while executing the commands.
- When we often have to use a single big command multiple times, in those cases, we create something called as _**alias**_ for that command.
- `alias` is like a shortcut command which will have same functionality as if we are writing the whole command.

## Syntax

```bash
$ alias [-p] [name[=value] ... ]
```

## Options/Flags

## How to permanently store aliases across sessions?

- We can store aliases in shell configuration files.
- For example for Bash Shell, we can write in `~/.bashrc`.
- Let us suppose we want to make an alias of changing to Documents directory as `CD`. For that go in the `.bashrc` file and write:

  ```bash
  $ alias CD="cd Documents"
  ```
