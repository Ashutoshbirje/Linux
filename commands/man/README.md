## Syntax
```bash
$man [OPTION]... [COMMAND NAME]...
```
---

## Options/Flags
- ###  No Option.
It displays the whole manual of the command.
    ```
    $ man [COMMAND NAME]
    ```
- ###  Section-num.
Since a manual is divided into multiple sections so this option is used to display only a specific section of a manual.
    ```
    $ man [SECTION-NUM] [COMMAND NAME]
    ```
    Example:
    ```
    $ man 2 intro
    ```
- ###   -f option.
One may not be able to remember the sections in which a command is present. So this option gives the section in which the given command is present.
    ```
    $ man -f [COMMAND NAME]
    ```
    Example:
    ```
    $ man -f ls
    ```
- ###   -a option.
This option helps us to display all the available intro manual pages in succession.
    ```
    $ man -a [COMMAND NAME]
    ```
    Example:
    ```
    $ man -a intro
    ```
- ###   -k option.
This option searches the given command as a regular expression in all the manuals and it returns the manual pages with the section number in which it is found
    ```
    $ man -k [COMMAND NAME]
    ```
    Example:
    ```
    $ man -k cd
    ```
- ###   -w option.
This option returns the location in which the manual page of a given command is present.
    ```
   $ man -w [COMMAND NAME]
    ```
    Example:
    ```
    $ man -w ls
    ```
- ###   -I option.
It considers the command as case sensitive.
    ```
   $ man -I [COMMAND NAME]
    ```
    Example:
    ```
    $ man -I printf
    ```
